Create ```.env``` file and copy paste there content from ```.env.example```. Change username,
password and dbname for DATABASE_URl to ones you use for the local Postgres instance.

SECRET_KEY=secret
DEBUG_MODE=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

Install project dependencies via pipenv:
```bash
pipenv install
```
If you run into ```ERROR: Couldn't install package: psycopg2``` error, export the following variables
```bash
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```
